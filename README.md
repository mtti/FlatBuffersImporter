## Installation

## As a Git dependency

Add to `manifest.json`, under `dependencies`:

```
"com.mattihiltunen.fbs": "https://github.com/mtti/FlatBuffersImporter.git",
```

## As an embedded Git submodule

```
git submodule add git@github.com:mtti/FlatBuffersImporter.git Packages/com.mattihiltunen.fbs
```

You can also add the `manifest.json` entry as above to document the dependency to this library.
